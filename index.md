# Project summary
The new platform, MyWonder, can perform big data analytics and visualizations from massive files. Previously, in order to analyze and visualize the massive files, the users need to wait for hours. However, we distribute the files on the cloud to improve efficiency and reduce waiting time. Now, MyWonder can not only help the users calculate their analytic and summary from their phone, even before they join the meeting and create visualizations from large files easily but also reduce executing and visualizing time from hours to under ten minutes. 

# Identified wastes

### Waiting
* For client and CEO, they wait for responses about explanation of terminology and contents from other departments.
* Waiting for a person to update contents used in the user interface before a demo. 

### Over-processing
* Multiple responding levels for a question about explanation of terminology and contents of the user interface.

### Skills
* Every team member needs to create a few visualiztion, but every team member is not necessarily good at creating visualization. 

# Deliverables
* Release of MyWonder UI with adding a "Note" area and clearable and understandable terminology and contents
* Release of independent environments for testing and production
* A Powerpoint with screenshots of the visualization
* A documentation with all the things which related to the project

# Milestone
